Unfortunately, I was not able to be in the first 40 minutes of the lesson this week, but I think I still made use of the time that I had on my hands. I talked to Mr Tansley about the work I had done at home, and how I could improve my virtual shop. The work I had done at home had made significant changes to my Westwood Park FC virtual shop, and these were improvements like adding in drop downs to get to the product easier, adding a total column and a discount column. The discount column was probably the hardest, as I had to use challenging code, and not necessarily code I had seen before. Eventually, I found out that the way to do it was talked through in the lesson, and I found it quite simple  It turned out to be quite simple. For next lesson, I need to add in a new discount which is the if you buy 10 or more items discount. I am looking forward to telling you how it goes!
