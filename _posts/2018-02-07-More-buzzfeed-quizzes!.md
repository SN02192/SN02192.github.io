In this week's IT lesson, we were carrying on with our buzzfeed quiz that we will produce by the end of the term. As I mentioned in another blog, my buzzfeed quiz is based on "What london football team you should support." I hope that my buzzfeed quiz will be fun and engaging, but will also be a good challenge for me, as I want to get better at programming. I find this topic very fun, as I am basing my coding around something I know and love, football. I find that this makes the coding easier, if you can incorporate something you know about. I also find buzzfeed quizzes quite fun, so I know if mine is not good enough. This all gives me incentive to work harder, and I feel like that makes me better at the subject. Mr Keen also showed us some of his buzzfeed quiz, and it is just incredible. It was by far the most complicated piece of code that I had ever seen. I hope that my quiz can be as good as Mr Keen, but I will certainly not be able to code like him! We were talking about how functions can be used in this instance, and the difference between a function and a procedure. We covered this in year 8 with Codecademy which meant that I understood that part of the lesson fairly well. Bring on next week with more challenges in my Buzzfeed code!
