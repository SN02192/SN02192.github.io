This week in IT, we were making our own virtual shop. We had to imagine that we were shop owners and that we were running our own shop. I imagined that I ran a shop for my local football team, Westwood Park FC. I was selling items like season tickets, replica home shirts, replica away shirt, Matchday programs, and single match tickets. Everything was at a great price! We were assembled around the board, to be told how to do the work. It was the most complicated coding that I have ever seen on a Google Sheet. I went back to my seat, and just tried my best. It was very hard. Not because the code was difficult, but there was a lot to remember from the gathering at the board. I had nearly finished when the lesson ended, but I really cracked the code (if you'll pardon the pun) when I got home. I was quite stuck for a while, but then I got a little bit of help from my dad, and then I was finished. I then tried to work out the 20% discount part. This was easier than I expected, as I used my code from the previous part to help me with my work./
