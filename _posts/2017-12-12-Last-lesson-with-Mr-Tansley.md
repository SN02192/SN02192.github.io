Last lesson was a very good one, except for the fact that Mr tansley told us that it would be the last lesson that we had with him. I was very sad about this as I felt that I had learned a lot from Mr Tansley, but I am looking forward to having Mr Keen again as he was our teacher in Year 7, and partly (for a term) in year 8. He is funny and you learn a lot from him. In the lesson, we caried on with our virtual shop. I made mine about Westwood Park, my football team. It is now finished and looks very good. 

Thank you Mr Tansley!
