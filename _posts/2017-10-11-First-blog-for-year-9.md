This week has actually been the second week that I have had IT for, because I was ill for one week, and we had enrichment day one other week. This is the first week however, that we have been tasked with making a blog post, and submitting it. We have a new IT teacher this year, and I feel like he is a very good teacher, and I am making good progress, and I think that by the end of the year, I will have very sufficient IT skills.

At the moment in IT we are working on encoding and decoding encrypted messages by using code. This is very interesting, as I have never done anything along these lines before, and I am excited to see how they go, and how I manage to cope with the challenge of something new, and how I go about solving the more difficult problems that I will face later this term. I very much enjoy learning about encrypted messages, as I can relate that to real life, as messages you send on WhatsApp are encrypted, and this is what they do to the messages, so that nobody can read them, except you, and the person/people that you are sending the message to. This is very good, as everything you say, is private to you, rather than on other social media sites like Instagram and Snapchat.

We started this topic by having a look at a simple message like "hello world" as Mr Tansley demonstrated on the board. He started us off very well, as he asked us to figure out what he had written and he had not told us how to do this. I have to admit that I had no idea how to go about this task, but miraculously somebody managed to work it out. Now Mr Tansley has explained it, I feel like I know how to address problems like that one on the board. However, we have been told that things will get harder next lesson!
