This lesson was another different but interesting one. We have started the project of making a buzzfeed quiz on repl.it. We were told to go and do a buzzfeed quiz, to see what we would be making. I now know that buzzfeed quizzes are very reliable, as I did a what harry potter house should I be in quiz and it put me in Gryffindor, which I know is correct, as I am very courageous, and have often been compared to the likes of Harry Potter and Dumbledore.

For my buzzfeed quiz, I have chosen what London football club you should support, helping those who do not already support a team decide, and then follow them passionately from that point on. The clubs I have chosen to put in my quiz are pretty much the biggest london clubs that there are (sorry Brentford) Chelsea, Arsenal, Spurs, Crystal Palace, West Ham, QPR and Millwall. I think that these teams will be an interesting comparison, as their fans are very different, and their stadiums are spread out around London. This helped me complete the questions, which was the homework we were set for the lesson. Then the lesson became quite different as I was sitting next to Mr Keen's desk while starting my questions, and I found out that he had been a steward at the old wembley stadium, and we were talking about football culture, and why it was acceptable to act in the way that football fans do, and I found this very interesting, as I had heard about football violence before from my dad, but I had never heard of it from a stewards point of view. That is why the lesson was so different than all of the others, but it was extremely interesting!
