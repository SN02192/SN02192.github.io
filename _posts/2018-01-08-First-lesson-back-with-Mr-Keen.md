This was the first lesson we had back with our old IT teacher, Mr Keen. I was very excited to hear that we would be doing python on real.it again, as we visited this last time we had Mr Keen, last Easter. I especially like python, because my dad likes python, and particularly likes teaching me it! I found this lesson quite difficult, as I had not visited python for quite a while,so I found it more difficult than I had anticipated. We were tasked with creating 3 questions for the python we had been doing in class. My questions were,

* What is your name

* How old are you

* Where do you live

I made clever responses to these, depending on the answer that you put in. The thing that I found the most challenging was the input functions, because I have not used those for a while. It took me about 30 minutes to get back to using them. 

I am very excited for next lesson, and I hope that it will be challenging and also fun. I am hoping to challenge myself by using difficult functions we learned last year.
