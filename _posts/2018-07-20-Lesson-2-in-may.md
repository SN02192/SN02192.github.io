This lesson we had was slightly different lesson to last week. We actually didn't do any coding at all. We talked about internet safety and the law. We talked about how nothing is ever deleted, which leaves you with a quite empty feeling in your stomach. We talked about how it is filtered down the system, and then stored somewhere, where hackers can access if you get an important job and they need to do background checks. The lesson got even more harrowing though, as we started to talk about somebodyâ€™s son who witnessed somebody committing sexual assault, but did not do anything about it. This took us on to talking about the implications of being on the sexual offenders register, and what that does to your chances of getting a job. This lesson really got me thinking about how small things can impact your life massively.
