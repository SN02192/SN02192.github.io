We have now started our GCSE courses, and we are doing IT as our enrichment subject. I was quite pleased when I found out that we were doing this, as IT is the subject of the future and it is key to have a base knowledge of the subject if I need it in future life. I was also especially pleased when I found out that  we would have Mr Keen as our teacher, as I really like him.

When we got into the lesson, we were told that if we wanted to, we could go back to scratch which is what we were doing in year 7 if we wanted to. I took this opportunity as I thought it would help me get a better basic understanding of computing.
