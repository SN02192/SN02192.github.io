On the 11th February, all of the English students were very nervous to meet their french exchanges. I was probably one of the most nervous of all of the DCGS students, as lots of the English students had been in touch with their exchanges before we had met them, but I had not. However, this turned out to be less important as I expected, as we bonded very quickly as the teachers had paired us together very well based on the information sheet we filled out a few weeks before the exchange. 

When we arrived home, my Mum told me that we should take the dog for a walk, so we could have some time alone to talk about our similarities. Luckily we clicked very fast, but he was keen to get home as the cold Autumn evenings were not what he was used to back home in Marseille! We came home for a dinner of Roast Chicken, which he loved!.

The next evening, we were very excited to go to the disco, and fortunately, he had a good time, and he enjoyed himself. We returned home very tired after the disco, and we went to bed very quickly, without being asked!

Saturday, in my opinion was the best day of the whole exchange. In the morning, I have football, and he came to cheer us on. This was so good, as our team won for the first time in roughly 6 months! In the afternoon, we went to a Wycombe Wanderers match, and it was a thrilling 0-0 draw. For lunch we had pies at the football, a very key part of English culture! We then went home and after another exhausting day, we sat down for an evening of FIFA, which was hard to understand, as it was French!

The next day proved to be even more tiring, as we went to Thorpe Park for the full day. Before going, I was worried that he would not like the rides, but he was very excited about all of them, especially the big ones!

Monday evening was another FIFA evening, as they had been to Cambridge during the day, and he was shattered! Tuesday was the night where everybody participating in the exchange went to PizzaExpress for dinner, which was very fun, meeting all of my exchanges friends, and having a nice evening with them. And finally, we said goodbye to our exchanges for the last time for 6 months. I had a great week, and it was very nice meeting my exchange.
