For this week's blog, Mr Keen asked us to talk about slightly different things such as the randomness of things such as Backgammon, which we watched Mr Keen play in the lesson, and demonstrate how un-randomit was. This was very amusing to watch, as Mr Keen was making a very good point. He was saying that when internet games were created, players complained that the random was too random. For instance, they would roll double 1 three times in a row, where that is just what happens when random is used, so companies started doing coding to change the random machine, so it generated more random, less random numbers (if that makes sense!). I found this very interesting, as I had never heard of this before, but I found it very funny. I do not understand how something can be "too random", and how people could complain about it. Mr Keen was also saying that if you choose hard while playing an internet board game like Backgammon, the computer will make it easier for the computer generated player to get the rolls that they need, where they will make it harder for you! That is why you should play on intermediate! The point of this lesson was to make us think about how when we play internet board games like Backgammon and Monopoly, the numbers generated are never really random, as people complained when it first came out! 

We were also tasked with embedding our code from previous lessons into the blog, so I apologize if that does not work!
